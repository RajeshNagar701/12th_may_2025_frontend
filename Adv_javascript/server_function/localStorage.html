<!--
localStorage in JavaScript is a web storage feature that allows web applications 
to store data as key-value pairs locally within the user's browser. 

This data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, meaning it has no 
expiration date. It's part of the Web Storage API, alongside sessionStorage.

// create
localStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");


//use
let username = localStorage.getItem("username");


//delete
localStorage.removeItem("username");   // single delete
localStorage.clear();                  // all storage variable delete

-->


<script>
	//localStorage.setItem("movie", "KGF-3");
	
	/*
	let movie = localStorage.getItem("movie");
	document.write(movie);
	*/
	
	
	//localStorage.removeItem("movie");
</script>
