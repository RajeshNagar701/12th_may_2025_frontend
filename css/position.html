The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

1)static (Default) : default so not used
2)relative : we can relatively left top bottom right box easily not affected any other box

	position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will 
cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to 
fit into any gap left by the element.


3)fixed
